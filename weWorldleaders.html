        <h3>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h3>
        <h4>Associate Justice of The Supreme Court</h4>
        <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a current associate justice of the Supreme Court and is well known for her work advocating for women<span>&#8217;</span>s rights. Growing up, Ginsburg<span>&#8217;</span>s mother took an active role in her education. This was because her own mother couldn<span>&#8217;</span>t further her own education past high school due to her family choosing to send her brother to college instead. But sadly before Ginsburg graduated from James Madison High School, her mother died. Yet this didn<span>&#8217;</span>t stop Ginsburg success in school as she graduated from Cornell at the top of her class and met her husband martin.
	She then attended Harvard for law school where she was one of nine women out of 500 men and face extreme gender descrimination. She was even asked why she was taking the spot of a man. On top of it all she also was juggling her own schooling with her sick husband recently diagnosed with cancer and motherhood. She would later move and graduate from Columbia law.
	Though work did not come easily and her payload was much less than her male counterparts. Though eventually, Ginsburg became the professor for the school of law at Columbia. In the 1970s Gisnburg directed the Women<span>&#8217;</span>s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union where she fought against gender descrimiation. Later appointed by Jimmy Carter for the District of Columbia<span>&#8217;</span>s Court of Appeals, Ginsburg would serve until 1993 when she was appointed to the supreme court by Bill Clinton.
