        <h3>Malala Yousafzai</h3>
        <h4>Female Education Activist</h4>
        <p>Malala Yousafzai, born on July 12, 1997, is Pakistani female education activist also known for being the being the youngest nobel peace prize recipient.
          In 2008 the Taliban took control of Malala<span>&#8217;</span>s home, Swat Valley and in 2012 became a target after speaking out about girl<span>&#8217;</span>s right to an education.
           On October 9, 2012 Malala was shot in the head by the Taliban, along with two of her classmates. She didn<span>&#8217;</span>t let this stop her from continuing to speak up though.
           After her long recovery, Malala started a fund with her father, the Malala Fund, dedicated to helping girls achieve their desired future. Influenced by her father<span>&#8217;</span>s activism, Malala has written for the Urdu BBC blog and has given many speeches.</p>
