    <h2>Teens:</h2>
    <p>Being apart of underrepresented minorities can be hard
    sometimes and it can really change your mood and how you
    view your life so here are some things you can do when
    you feel like you're alone in this big world.
            </p>
            <li>Be a role model! This is the most important thing you can
                  do to help. Having someone to look up to, doing all the right
                  things, can be influential on your child, especially when a
                  relationship is already established.</li>
                  <li>As well as being a role model, make a safe space to talk
          about feelings. Sometimes your child may not know you can talk
          about things, such as feelings. This topic is uncomfortable
          for young children so once you welcome it with open arms
          it'll be easier to talk about it on your child's part</li>
          <br>
          <p>Here's a list of programs you can do to truly find your passion,
      whether its law, medicine, or computer science, or even just
      connecting with people by identity.</p>

<h2>Parents/Guardians:</h2>
<p>Hello parents and guardians! Or really any adult figure in
  a child's life. You may feel or see your child struggling
  but not know how to help or if you even should. Here's a list
  we strongly encoueage you follow.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li>Be a role model! This is the most important thing you can
      do to help. Having someone to look up to, doing all the right
      things, can be influential on your child, especially when a
      relationship is already established.</li>
      <br>
        <li>As well as being a role model, make a safe space to talk
        about feelings. Sometimes your child may not know you can talk
        about things, such as feelings. This topic is uncomfortable
        for young children so once you welcome it with open arms
        it'll be easier to talk about it on your child's part</li>
        <br>
        <li>Another thing is to share your experiences. Your child may
          alone in some situations, and if you guys have an experience
          that overlaps eachother then you can share your knowledge
          specifcally on that. Even if the situation isn't similar,
          sharing things that you went through will show your child
          that you went through hard times as well, and that you
          perservered, and still made it in life.</li>
