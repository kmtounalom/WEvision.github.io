        <h3>Mirai Nagasu</h3>
        <h4>American figure skater</h4>
        <p>Mirai Nagasu was born on April 16, 1993 in Montebello, California. Raised by her Japanese immigrant parents, owner of a sushi restaurant in Arcadia, Nagasu learned a strong work ethic from a young age and by the age of 5 she was skating. Though oddly enough, Nagasu<span>&#8217;</span>s parents wanted her to be a golfer and took her golfing everyday. It wasn<span>&#8217;</span>t till one day when they went to the ice rink instead because of the rain. She<span>&#8217;</span>s instead on going back ever since.
          Since the day she started skating, Nagsu has been training and competing. In 2007, Nagasu won silver at the Junior Worlds. She continued to compete and even went to the 2010 Winter Olympics at the age of 16 where she placed fourth in the ladies event. Although times were not always smooth sailing. During the 2016 US championships, Nagasu<span>&#8217;</span>s right boot ripped during a skate and she had to manage to power through to finish the routine. Most people now know Nagasu for becoming the first female american figure skater to land a triple axel during competition.</p>
